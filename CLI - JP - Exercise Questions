Your PI an Apple biologist has given you a archive of files included is a list of genes from a recent project in a
gene annotation file,  as well as some questions.

You can access the information from this and other files to find out more about the experimental results.

This can be done conveniently from the command line.

Some questions you have been asked are as follows:

How many chromosomes are in this genome?

How many genes and transcript variants (alternative splicing)

How many single variants

How many genes have multiple variants

How many genes are on the '+' vs '-' strand of the chromosome

How many genes are on a particular Chromosome

How many transcripts are on a particular Chromosome

Compare genes that are found in common between two experimental conditions, condition A and condition B
