#Start out by checking your location

      `$ pwd`

#From the project directory you want to change directory to the
#directory with the files (this depends on your directory structure!)

      `$ cd ~/CLI/gencommand_proj1_data`

#List the files to see the content of the directory

      `$ ls -l`

#Our first question asks, how many chromosomes are there in the genome
#Looking at the apple.genome file we see that there is genomic information
#in multi-fasta format

      `$ more apple.genome`

#in this file type each new chromosome is designated by a ">" symbol followed by an identifier then everything is
#followed by the sequence. The command `grep` allows us to search a file line by line to looking for a specific pattern.
#We can use `grep` to search the file line by line for the pattern ">"

      `$ grep ">" apple.genome`

#Great, we have our results. What if this file had 100 chromosomes, 1000 chromosomes, it is helpful to get a count
#of the lines that `grep` found. there are 2 options for this

      `$ grep ">" apple.genome | wc -l` or

      `$ grep -c ">" apple.genome`

#In the file `apple.genes` each line represents a different transcript variant, the columns for apple.gene are:
#"geneID","transcriptID","chrom", "strand", "transcriptStart", "transcriptEnd","transcriptStructure"
#to answer the question: How many Genes? we will look at column #1 (aka "field1") since counting the distinct number
#of 'geneID' will give us the number of distinct genes. To analyze column #1 `cut` it, this trims the file to a one column
#file, then we will `sort` using -u flag to only sort distinct (unique) names, finally we will pipe that data to `wc` with -l flag
#to count the number of lines. This will give us the number of unique genes in apple.genes.

      `cut -f1 apple.genes | sort -u | wc -l`

#To find the number of transcripts we have to look at the number of distinct names in column#2 (aka field2) following
#the previous approach:

      `cut -f2 apple.genes | sort -u | wc -l`

#To determine which genes have single vs multiple variants we will look at column#1 because the number
#of splice variants for a gene is given by the number of lines that have that geneID in column#1. To determine
#the number of lines for each gene and then extract only the genes that have exactly one line. This examples uses
#`uniq` command which reports the lines that are repeated in a file, - the `-c` flag gives a count of the number of times
#the line occurred in the input.

      `cut -f1 apple.genes | sort | uniq -c | grep -c "1"`

#To find out which genes have multiple variants you change up the approach from above but count the number of genes
#with more than one line. `grep -v` allows us to find all lines not matching the pattern

      `cut -f1 apple.genes | sort | uniq -c | grep -v "1" | wc -l`

#Now that we know plenty about the genes and their variants, we want to find out which strand of the chromosome has
#more genes on it. Column#4 has the strand information but merely looking at column#4 alone will not give us the answer
#we are looking for since some genes have multiple transcript variants all of which are located on the same strand. After
#cutting and sorting we will extract the strand column and count the number of entries of each type

      `$ cut -f1,4 apple.genes | sort -u | cut -f2 | sort | uniq -c`

#Similar to the prior question we will subset geneID's and to determine how many genes are on each chromosome
we will work with column#3 (chrom)

      `$ cut -f1,3 apple.genes | sort -u | cut -f2 | sort | uniq -c`
#Our last bit of work with the apple.genes file will be to determine how many transcripts are on each chromosome. To
#answer this we will approach the question in a similar way to the prior questions but since we are looking to find
#transcripts per chromosome we will need to examine column#2 and column#3. Since each transcriptID is unique already
#unlike the geneID which could have duplicates we can simplify the workflow. See it both ways to make sure for yourself

      `$ cut -f2,3 apple.genes | cut -f2 | sort | uniq -c` or
      `$ cut -f2,3 apple.genes | sort -u | cut -f2 | sort | uniq -c`

#In our final question we are asked to find out which genes are common between experimental conditions, and which are
#specific to either one or another experimental condition. To execute on this task we will learn about a new command not
#covered yet. `comm` The `comm` utility reads file1 and file2, which should be sorted lexically,and produces three
#text columns as output: lines only in file1; lines only in file2; and lines in both files. First we will find which
#genes are in common between condition A and condition B. GeneID's are found in column#1 of the apple.condition* files.
#We need to isolate the unique geneID's of each condition to compare between them. The best way to approach this is sending
#the output of the sort to a new file. After doing this for each condition we can then try out the new command `comm` we
#learned. It is useful to know we can limit what output we see from comm using option (-1, -2, -3)

      `$ cut -f1 apple.conditionA | sort -u > apple.condA.sorted.genes`
      `$ cut -f1 apple.conditionB | sort -u > apple.condB.sorted.genes`
      `$ comm -1 -2 apple.condA.sorted.genes apple.condB.sorted.genes | wc -l`

#We can now use our options with `comm` and the special purpose files we created to find out how many genes correspond
#to condition A or condition B.

#Condition A
      `$ comm -3 -2 apple.condA.sorted.genes apple.condB.sorted.genes | wc -l`

#Condition B
      `$ comm -3 -1 apple.condA.sorted.genes apple.condB.sorted.genes | wc -l`

#Finally if we were interested in counting how many genes are in common in all 3 conditions we have to think of an approach
#that doesnt use `comm` as looking at all 3 conditions doesnt allow for a pairwise comparison. To do this we can create
#a list of genes for each of the 3 conditions. To combine the gene lists that we have from our sorted files we would
#use a new command `cat` which combines files together end to end "concatenating" them. The rest is determining the counts
#for each gene, and then determining the number of entries with that appear "3" times.
      `$ cat apple.cond{A,B,C}.sorted.genes | sort | uniq -c | grep -c " 3 "`
