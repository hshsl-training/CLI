### 1 - Start out by checking your location

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
pwd
```

### 2 - From the project directory you want to change directory to the directory with the files (this depends on your directory structure!)

```{bash, eval = FALSE} 
cd ~/mydirectory
```

### 3 - List the files to see the content of the directory

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ls -l
```


### 4 - The first information to find out is how many chromosomes there are in the example genome. Looking at the apple.genome file we see that there is genomic information in multi-fasta format.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
more apple.genome
```

### 5 - The command `grep` allows us to search a file line by line looking for a specific pattern. In the current `apple.genome` file, each new chromosome is designated by a ">" symbol followed by an identifier then the sequence. We can use `grep` to search the file line by line for the pattern ">" to determine the number of chromosomes
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
grep ">" apple.genome
```
